## Topic 0 - Introduction
- Rundown of result from analysis on the new dataset

## Remarks
- Columns from previous rapid data set should be ignored
- P and N are subjected to cutoff


## Explanation from Mahmoud
- 1. The rapid test and the ELISA assay are commercial but from two different manufacturers. Therefore, from our team's point of view it would be interesting on differential (comparing) diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of both using the same set of sera.
- 2. In case the IgM values do not correlate with onset of symptoms as in the case of ELISA, what does this immunologically mean.
- 3. In case IgM reactivity of the rapid test correlate with symptoms as we briefly saw at the end of the meeting, what does this mean.
- 4. What can we conclude out of this.


## Tasks
- Classify the ELISA raw data into > or = 0.5 or less than 0.5 and record the incidence of symptoms in both groups.
- Classify the rapid test data into > or = 10 or less than 10 and record the incidence of symptoms in both groups
- Creating github users (Participants)
- Invitation to repo (Mandela)
